Getting the Server started 
Mongo Clusters are protected with a client username and pass
Normally u just type npm start and it runs but i had to hide the pass
so that it doesnt end up on a public site. So pls ask me for the .env file.

Step 1: Make sure you are in the backend folder

Step 2: Npm i (if you havent done so )

Step 3: Npm Start

IF IT FAILS, which it probably should see next step 

Step 4: You need the .env file from me it has the db password 
and i dont want that pushed on git by mistake.Its like a 2 line page lol

step 4: Run npm start
after dragging file over make sure its a .env file
Rerun and you should see a port number after nodemon 
loads.
